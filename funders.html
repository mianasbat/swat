      University College London  This event   Julia: A Fresh Approach to
      Numerical Computing    Abstract   Julia is a relatively new programming
      language, mainly designed for numerical computing, which is gaining more
      and more attention in the scientific community because of the speed and
      the high productivity it provides. This talk will go through some of
      Julia's main features, presenting also the largest present and future
      scientific applications written in this language. </p>
